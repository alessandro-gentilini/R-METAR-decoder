R-METAR-decoder
===============

A METAR decoder written in R - work in progress!

The description of METAR decodification is based on two manuals, there are some small differences between two METAR formats, I call them the _international_ format amd the _USA_ format.

The international format is described in a manual from the World Meteorological Organization:

Manual on Codes
International Codes
Volume I.1
(Annex II to WMO Technical Regulations)
Part A – Alphanumeric Codes
WMO-No. 306
2011 edition
